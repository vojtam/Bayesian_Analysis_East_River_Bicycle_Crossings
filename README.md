# Bayesian models project

> The aim of this project was to analyze the number of cyclists during 214 days of the year 2016. The analysis of this data can be useful, for example, for planning maintenance, construction of new cycling routes and paths, urban planning, and policy-making. Personally, I was interested in answers to two questions. The first concerns the percentage decrease in the number of cyclists on days when precipitation was recorded (at least
). The second question deals with the number of cyclists on weekends versus weekdays. I was interested in whether more people use bicycles for commuting to work or for weekend sports activities.
